**Soil Moisture Sensor State Diagram

I am planning to create a soil mositure sensor that will alert the user through a buzzer as well as a red LED when the moisure is below a threshold of 700.  
There would also be a "yellow" or warning level when the moisture is between 700 and 900.  In this case, just the yellow LED will be on (and the buzzer is off).
If the mositure is above 900, the LED would be green and there would be no buzzer.
