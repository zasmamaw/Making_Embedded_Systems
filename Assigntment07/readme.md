Exercise 7
Each chapter in the book ends with an interview question followed by the analysis of what an interviewer would look for in an answer. Write one of these yourself.
Start with an interview question you have asked or one that youâ€™ve been asked (or one from the internet). Then write up what an interviewer would look for in an answer. Be specific about how the interviewer might help the interviewee if they get stuck.
