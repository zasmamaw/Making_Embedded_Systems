Exercise 7
----------
Each chapter in the book ends with an interview question followed by the analysis of what an interviewer would look for in an answer. Write one of these yourself.
Start with an interview question you have asked or one that youâ€™ve been asked (or one from the internet). Then write up what an interviewer would look for in an answer. Be specific about how the interviewer might help the interviewee if they get stuck.

"You have just recieved your first prototype board, and the unit would not power up.  What would you do next?"

Among other scenarios,  I like to ask this question since its a realistic scenario and also lets me see their debug process.  Answers can be hardware/ EE focused (such as I would start probing/scoping the key power pins) or software focused (such as checking the proper power up sequence / pin definitions are set).  Whatever the answer maybe, there will be followup "Why?" or "What if that is okay?  What next?"  These followups will reveal the breadth and depth of the candidate's problem solving skills.
