Exercise 2.1 

Idea project diagram 

Make a block diagram describing an embedded system you’d like to have or make. Be imaginative. Reality does not apply here. 

I chose to create the diagram for a smart plant monitor systems.  It reads various sensors (ALS, temp, humidity, soil moisture, soil pH) to trigger a water pump as well as a shield for protecting against the sun.

Exercise 2.2 

Read mbed code, make diagram.

Create a block diagram for this program, briefly explain why you chose the platform and template you did, be prepared to talk about this board in Live Class.


I chose the LPC55S69 board since it uses a Cortex-M33 arm microcontroller,  which is similar to the processor used by the STM32U5 development board that I am planning to use for my final project.  The template I chose is an appliciation of WiFi APIs.  It is for an LPC55S69 with ESP8266 wifi module.  The program brings up the Wi-Fi network interface and uses it to scan available networks, connect to a network, and prints interface and connection details.
