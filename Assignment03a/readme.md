Exercise 3a
******
Investigate project board

Look at the documents for the board you are considering for your final project (or any ST Discovery Board), draw the hardware block diagram for the board. For peripherals, note the communication paths (SPI, I2C, etc).

Look at the datasheet for the processor and other documents. Answer these questions:

-What kind of processor is it?

-How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?

-Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you noted as being interesting.)

-Does it have a floating point unit?

-If it has an ADC, what are the features?

Look at one application note for this processor.

The board I am considering for my project is the STM32U5 DISCOVERY KIT FOR IOT (B-U585I-IOT02A).  I chose this board primarily for the rich set of sensors that it includes.  Below is the hardware block diagram, along with wide variety of peripheral devices that it features:

The processor is the STM32U585AI.
